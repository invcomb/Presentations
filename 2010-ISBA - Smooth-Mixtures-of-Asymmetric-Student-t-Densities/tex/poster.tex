  A general model is proposed for flexibly estimating the density of a continuous response
  variable conditional on a possibly high-dimensional set of covariates. The model is a
  finite mixture of asymmetric student-\emph{t} densities with covariate-dependent mixture
  weights. The four parameters of the components, the mean, degrees of freedom, scale and
  skewness, are all modeled as functions of the covariates.

    The split-\emph{t} density is
\[
f\left( {y;\mu ,\phi ,\lambda ,\nu } \right) = \begin{cases} 
c \cdot \kappa \left( {y;\mu ,\phi ,\nu} \right); &\text{if } y \leq \mu, \\
 c \cdot \kappa \left( {y;\mu ,\lambda \phi ,\nu} \right); &\text{if } y > \mu,
\end{cases}
\]
where $ \kappa \left( {y;\mu ,\phi ,\nu} \right) $ is the kernel of student \emph{t} density and $c$ is the normalization constant.

Given $x$, a finite mixture distribution $p(y|x)$ is 
  \[
  \sum\nolimits_{k = 1}^K {\omega _k f_k \left( {y_i |\theta _k } \right),~i = 1,...,n.} 
  \]
A smooth mixture model is a finite mixture density with weights that are smooth function
of the covariates, e.g 
\[
\omega _k \left( x \right) = \frac{{\exp \left( {x'\gamma _k } \right)}}
{{\sum\nolimits_{r = 1}^K {\exp \left( {x'\gamma _r } \right)} }}
\]
In a smooth mixture of split-\emph{t} densities, the four components $\mu,\phi,\lambda$
and $\nu$ in each mixture components are connected to covariates as, e.g.,
\[
\begin{array}{*{20}c}
   {~~~\mu  = \beta _{\mu _0 }  + x_t '\beta _\mu  ,} & {\ln \phi  = \beta _{\phi _0 }  + x_t '\beta _\phi  ,}  \\
   {\ln \nu  = \beta _{\nu _0 }  + x_t '\beta _\nu  ,} & {\ln \lambda  = \beta _{\lambda _0 }  + x_t '\beta _\lambda  .}  \\
 \end{array} 
\]

Financial data, such as stock market returns, are typically heavy tailed and subject to volatility
clustering. The model is applied to analyse the distribution of daily
stock market returns conditional on nine covariates and outperforms widely used GARCH models
and other recently proposed mixture models in an out-of-sample evaluation of returns during the
recent financial crisis.

We use normalized residuals to assess the quality of the predictive densities. The
SMR (\emph{simple-and-many} approach) with largest LPDS produces much to large residuals during the most 
volatile period, and so does the GARCH(1,1) and \emph{t}-GARCH(1, 1). The
one-component split-\emph{t} model is doing remarkably well during this very difficult
time period.

LPDS shows that the SMR model does poorly, even with a large number of
components, and is outperformed by the GARCH(1, 1) and \emph{t}-GARCH(1, 1) models.
The split-t with covariate dependent scale,
skewness and degrees of freedom is the best one-component model.

We estimate one-component split-\emph{t} model using first 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 trading
days and the full 
sample. Then we obtain conditional predictive densities for three sets of covariates
low, medium and high volatility. It is shown that the predictive densities is 
stable even with very high volatility data.

The median of the degrees of freedom actually increased during the most volatile part of the financial
crisis (but at the same time the scale parameter rose dramatically to bring about a very large boost
in standard deviation of returns), but, during some spells, the posterior distribution of $\nu$ also has
a long left tail with substantial probability mass on very small values of $\nu$.
