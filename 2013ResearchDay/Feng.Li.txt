Title:

Complex model for complex data, the statistical approach

Summary:

Statistical methods have been developed rapidly in the past
twenty years.  One driving factor of this development is
that more and more complicated high-dimensional data require
sophisticated data analysis methods. A noticeably successful
case is the machine learning field which is now wildly used
in industry. Another reason are the dramatic advancements in
the statistical computational environment. Computationally
expensive methods that in the past could only be run on
expensive super computers are now possible to run on a
standard PC. This has created an enormous momentum for
statistical analysis where complex models are typically
analyzed with modern computer-intensive methods. In this
talk we will discuss how complex statistical models can be
applied in several challenging data in finance and other
areas.
