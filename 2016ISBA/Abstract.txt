Modelling tail-dependence with stocks and financial news information

copula tail-dependence modeling with flexible marginal distributions is widely used in
financial time series. most of the available copula approaches for estimating
tail-dependence are restricted within certain types of bivariate copulas due to
computational complexity. we propose a general bayesian approach for jointly modeling
high-dimensional tail-dependence for financial returns and related news information.

Our method allows for variable selection among the key words in news in the copula
tail-dependence parameters. We apply a novel sampling technique into the posterior
inference where the likelihood function is estimated from a random subset of the data,
resulting in substantially fewer density MCMC evaluations.
