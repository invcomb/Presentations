\noindent {\bf Abstract:} Copula tail-dependence modeling with flexible marginal
distributions is widely used in financial time series. Most of the available Copula
approaches for estimating tail-dependence are restricted within certain types of bivariate
copulas due to computational complexity. We propose a general Bayesian approach for
jointly modeling high-dimensional tail-dependence with general copulas functionals. Our
method allows for variable selection among the covariates in the copula tail-dependence
parameters. We apply a novel sampling technique into the posterior inference where the
likelihood function is estimated from a random subset of the data, resulting in
substantially fewer density MCMC evaluations.
